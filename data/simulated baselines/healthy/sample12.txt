During my sophomore year, I volunteered at the local animal shelter every weekend. At first, I was scared to handle the dogs, but I quickly learned how gentle and grateful they were. I remember one pit bull named Rosie who was especially nervous. I sat with her for weeks, slowly earning her trust. The day she finally let me walk her felt like a breakthrough. A few weeks later, I was there when a kind couple adopted her. I cried—happy tears. That experience taught me patience, kindness, and how healing love can be, for animals and people alike. Volunteering wasn’t just about helping them; it helped me grow, too. I still carry Rosie’s story with me in my heart.
