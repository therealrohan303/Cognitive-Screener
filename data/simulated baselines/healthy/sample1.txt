One of my favorite childhood memories is our family trip to the mountains when I was ten. We stayed in a small wooden cabin surrounded by towering pine trees and the scent of fresh air. Each morning, my dad would make pancakes while my sister and I ran outside to collect pinecones. We hiked scenic trails, laughed around campfires, and even saw a family of deer one evening. I remember lying under a blanket of stars, listening to my mom tell stories. That trip made me feel safe, curious, and connected to nature. Even now, I sometimes close my eyes and imagine those peaceful woods. It was one of the first times I truly felt a sense of wonder and belonging.
