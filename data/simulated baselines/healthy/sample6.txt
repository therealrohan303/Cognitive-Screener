In seventh grade, I worked on a science fair project about water filtration with my best friend, Lucas. We spent weeks testing different materials—charcoal, sand, even crushed shells. Our garage looked like a mad scientist’s lab, but we loved every minute. The night before the presentation, our final prototype actually turned muddy water crystal clear. The next day, our teacher was amazed, and we ended up winning first place. I remember feeling a deep sense of accomplishment—not just because we won, but because we built something real together. That experience taught me the joy of experimenting, failing, and trying again. It also showed me that collaboration, even with duct tape and chaos, can lead to something truly rewarding.
