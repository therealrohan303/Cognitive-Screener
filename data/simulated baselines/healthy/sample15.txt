One day in high school, I stayed late to help clean up after an event. I didn’t think anyone noticed, but as I was leaving, my teacher pulled me aside and said, “You have a quiet strength. Don’t underestimate it.” I didn’t know what to say—I just smiled and nodded. That compliment stayed with me for years. It came at a time when I often felt invisible and unsure of myself. To be seen, even in such a small moment, shifted something inside me. It taught me that kindness, especially when unexpected, can last a long time. I try to pass that on now—to notice and name the good in others, because it can mean more than we realize.
