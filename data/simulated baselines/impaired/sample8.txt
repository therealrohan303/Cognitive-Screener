I went to the doctor. The doctor had a coat. A white coat. He asked questions. I forgot what he said. I think I said yes. Maybe no. There was a nurse. She had paper. I sat. I sat on the chair. The chair was cold. Or maybe it was soft. I don’t know. I looked at the wall. The wall had posters. Pictures of bones. Bones and teeth. Or lungs. I don’t remember. They checked something. Maybe my blood. I don’t like needles. I looked away. Then it was done. Or maybe not done. I think I came home. I think I came home after. It was a long day. Or short. I forgot what he said.
