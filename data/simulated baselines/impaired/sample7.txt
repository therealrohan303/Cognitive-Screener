There’s a movie I like. I watched it. It had a man. And a woman. They did something. I think they ran. They were running. Or flying. Maybe it was in space. Or a jungle. I don’t know. The music was loud. Very loud. The music was good. The man had a hat. Or a coat. Maybe both. There was a dog too. I think. Or not. It was funny. Or sad. I liked it. I forgot the name. But I liked it. I watched it again. I think I watched it again. Maybe I didn’t. But I wanted to. It was a good movie. I think.
