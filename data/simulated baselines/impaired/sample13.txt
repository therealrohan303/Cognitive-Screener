I needed food. I went to the store. I took a cart. The cart made noise. I pushed it. I went down the aisle. There were cans. And boxes. I needed bread. And milk. Maybe eggs. I saw apples. Red apples. Or green. I took some. I forgot what else I needed. I looked at a list. The list was gone. I didn’t have it. I think I forgot it. Then I saw cereal. I like cereal. I took two. Or maybe one. I don’t remember. I went to pay. The cashier talked. I smiled. I paid. I left. I put bags in the car. I drove home. Or I think I did.
