I went for a walk. I went walking. I like walking. I saw trees. And people. And trees again. There were birds. The birds made noise. It was a good noise. The path was long. Or short. I walked far. I think I did. Maybe not far. I sat down. There was a bench. A wooden bench. I sat and looked. The sky was blue. Or maybe gray. It changed. I think it changed. Then I saw someone. I waved. Maybe they waved back. I donâ€™t know. Then I walked again. I walked and walked. I forgot where I was going. But I got there. I think. I went walking.
