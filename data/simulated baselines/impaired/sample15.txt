It rained today. It was raining. Rain on the window. Rain on the street. The cars were wet. Everything was wet. I watched the rain. I like rain. It makes noise. A soft noise. Or loud. It rained a lot. I stayed inside. I had tea. Or coffee. I think tea. I sat by the window. The rain didn’t stop. It kept going. I saw people walking. With umbrellas. Some didn’t have them. They were wet. The trees moved. The wind was strong. Or not strong. I don’t remember. The rain fell. And fell. Then it stopped. Maybe it stopped. I think it did. Or not.
