I turned on the TV. The remote didn’t work. Then it did. I pressed buttons. I watched something. A show. With people. They talked. I think it was funny. Or sad. I don’t remember. I got a snack. Then I sat again. The couch was soft. Or not. The volume was too loud. Or too low. I fixed it. I watched more. The people did things. I think they argued. Or sang. I watched it before. Or maybe not. It looked the same. Or maybe it was new. I don’t know. The show ended. Then something else came on. I watched that too. Then I turned it off. Or maybe I didn’t.
