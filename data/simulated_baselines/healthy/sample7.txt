My first job was at a local bookstore during high school. I was nervous at first—scanning barcodes, answering questions, and organizing shelves felt overwhelming. But the quiet atmosphere and the smell of old paper quickly became comforting. One day, a little girl came in looking for a book on dinosaurs, and I helped her find the perfect one. The way her face lit up made me realize how much small actions can matter. Over time, I got better at customer service and even made friends with regulars. That job didn’t pay much, but it taught me responsibility, patience, and how to work with people. I still visit that store sometimes, and it always feels like a second home.
