When I was nine, we adopted a scruffy brown dog named Max from the shelter. He was shy and wouldn’t come near anyone at first. I spent hours sitting quietly next to him, reading aloud or offering treats. Slowly, he started to trust me. The first time he rested his head on my lap, I felt a warmth I’d never known before. Max became my shadow—following me to the bus stop, sleeping by my bed, and even learning to shake paws. He was more than a pet; he was my best friend during some tough years. His loyalty taught me about love, trust, and how healing companionship can be. Max made my childhood better in ways words can’t describe.
