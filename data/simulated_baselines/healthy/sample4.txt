My first day of high school was a whirlwind of nerves and excitement. I remember waking up extra early to pick out the perfect outfit and double-check my schedule. The hallways buzzed with students, and I clutched my backpack like a lifeline. But in the chaos, I met Jamie, who was just as anxious as I was. We sat next to each other in English class, bonded over our mutual love of fantasy books, and instantly clicked. That small moment of connection made everything feel less scary. By the end of the day, I had found a friend and a little bit of confidence. It reminded me that even when change feels overwhelming, it can lead to something beautiful.
