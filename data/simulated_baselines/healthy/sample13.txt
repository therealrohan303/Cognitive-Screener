In eighth grade, I entered a small art contest at my library. I spent hours working on a watercolor painting of a tree I used to climb as a kid. The painting wasn’t perfect, but it felt personal. I submitted it with shaky hands and didn’t expect much. A week later, I got a call saying I’d won third place. I was shocked—but proud. My painting was displayed in the library, and my friends came to see it. For the first time, I saw myself as creative and capable. That little win gave me confidence I didn’t know I needed. It reminded me that putting yourself out there, even when you’re unsure, can lead to something unexpectedly beautiful.
