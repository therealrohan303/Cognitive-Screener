I still remember my eighth birthday party like it happened yesterday. My parents surprised me with a space-themed celebration in our backyard. They hung glow-in-the-dark stars, and everyone wore silly astronaut helmets. My friends and I played “moonwalk tag” and launched model rockets that my uncle helped us build. When it got dark, we lay on blankets and watched the sky, trying to spot constellations. I felt like the center of the universe, not because it was my birthday, but because I was surrounded by people who loved me. That day was full of laughter, excitement, and awe. It taught me how magical ordinary places can become when shared with people who care. I still cherish that memory.
