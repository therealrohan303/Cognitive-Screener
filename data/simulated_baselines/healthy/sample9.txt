I learned to ride a bike one golden afternoon with my dad running beside me. I kept falling, scraping my knees and wanting to quit, but he kept saying, “One more try.” Eventually, I felt the wobble disappear and realized he’d let go—I was riding on my own. I shouted out in surprise and pride, pedaling faster than I ever had. That moment, with the wind on my face and the sound of his cheering behind me, felt like pure freedom. I still remember the smell of grass and the evening light stretching across the sidewalk. Learning to ride wasn’t just about balance—it was my first taste of independence. Every time I ride now, I think of that day.
