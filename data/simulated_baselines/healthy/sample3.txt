When I was twelve, I taught myself how to play the guitar. My grandfather gave me his old acoustic, and though the strings were worn, it felt like holding a treasure. Every evening after school, I would sit by the window, strumming chords from online tutorials. At first, it sounded terrible—my fingers hurt, and I almost gave up. But slowly, the sounds became melodies, and one day, I played “Let It Be” for my mom. She smiled and clapped, and I felt proud in a way I never had before. Learning guitar taught me patience and persistence. Even now, music is my favorite way to express emotions I can’t put into words. It all started with that dusty guitar.
