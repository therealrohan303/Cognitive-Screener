One rainy Saturday, when I was around ten, the power went out and my family decided to make the most of it. We lit candles around the living room, and my mom pulled out an old board game we hadn’t played in years. As the storm rumbled outside, we laughed, argued over silly rules, and forgot all about the Wi-Fi. My dad made grilled cheese sandwiches on the stovetop and we ate by candlelight. That simple evening felt magical—peaceful, warm, and full of love. Without screens or distractions, we really connected. It made me realize how much joy lives in the little moments. Even now, every time it rains, I remember that night and feel a quiet sort of happiness.
