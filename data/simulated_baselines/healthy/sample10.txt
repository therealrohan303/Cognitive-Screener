In fifth grade, I was cast as the narrator in our school play. I was thrilled until I realized I’d have to speak in front of everyone. The first rehearsal was a disaster—my voice shook, and I forgot my lines. But my teacher encouraged me, reminding me that it was okay to be scared. I practiced every evening, reading aloud to my mirror, then to my family. On the night of the performance, my hands were trembling, but once I began, something clicked. The words flowed, the audience smiled, and I finished with a bow and a huge grin. That experience taught me that fear doesn’t mean failure. Sometimes, the bravest thing is simply showing up and trying again.
