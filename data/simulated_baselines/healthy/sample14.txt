The first time I cooked a full meal by myself, I made spaghetti for my parents. I followed an online recipe, chopped garlic way too slowly, and accidentally spilled sauce on the stove. Still, the kitchen smelled amazing. I set the table and called them in with nervous pride. They took the first bite and smiled—it wasn’t perfect, but it was good. That dinner felt like a small rite of passage. I realized that creating something from scratch, even messy and flawed, is deeply satisfying. Cooking became more than a chore; it turned into a quiet joy. Now it’s one of my favorite ways to relax and show love. It all started with that one wobbly attempt.
