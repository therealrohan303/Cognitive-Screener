One summer, my grandmother broke her leg and had to stay with us while she recovered. At first, I didn’t know how to help, but soon I became her little assistant. I brought her tea, helped her do crosswords, and even learned how to cook her favorite lentil soup. In return, she told me stories about her childhood in India—riding bikes without brakes and dancing barefoot at weddings. I started looking forward to our time together, and she often said I made her healing easier. That summer, I learned empathy in a way school never taught me. It wasn’t a vacation or a holiday, but it brought us closer than we had ever been. I’ll always treasure that time.
