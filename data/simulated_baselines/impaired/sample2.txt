We went on a trip. The trip was long. We were on the road. I saw trees. Trees and trees. And then there were trees. The car was blue. I think it was blue. Or green. It was fast. I was with my sister or maybe my aunt. I don’t know. We listened to music. The music was music. Then we stopped. I don’t remember why we stopped. I think we ate food. There was food. It was hot or cold. The hotel had stairs. I don’t like stairs. I like elevators. Or maybe not. Then we came home. It was fun, I think. The trees were there. I remember the trees the most.
