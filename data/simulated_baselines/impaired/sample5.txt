School was big. Big and full. Full of people. I had a teacher. She had glasses. Or maybe he did. The class had chairs. And a clock. I sat near the door. Or the window. We did reading. We read books. I liked one book. It was about a dog. Or maybe a cat. There were pencils. I dropped mine a lot. Then we had lunch. Lunch was food. Food in trays. My friend gave me half a cookie. It was good. I don’t remember the subject. Maybe math. Or spelling. We had spelling tests. I did okay. Or not okay. The bell rang. We went outside. Or maybe we stayed in. The teacher said goodbye. Or she didn’t.
