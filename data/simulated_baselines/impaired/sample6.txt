I tried to cook. I tried to make eggs. Eggs are easy. Easy to make. I used the pan. The pan was hot. It was hot and made noise. The oil made noise. Then I forgot. I think I forgot to put the eggs in. Or maybe I did. I don’t know. I looked for salt. The salt was not there. Maybe it was. I cooked something. I don’t know what. It was brown. Brown and warm. I ate it. It tasted okay. I think it was okay. Or maybe it was too salty. I don’t remember. Then I sat down. The food was gone. The pan was still hot. Or not. I forgot to turn something off. I think.
