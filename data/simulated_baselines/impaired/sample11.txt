It was my birthday. A birthday with cake. There was cake. Chocolate, I think. Or maybe vanilla. There were people. Some people I know. Some I didn’t. There were balloons. Balloons and hats. I had a hat. It was red or blue. I blew out the candles. I think I made a wish. I don’t remember the wish. I got a gift. A box. A box with paper. I opened it. It had something. I don’t remember. But it was nice. We ate. There was food. I dropped something. People laughed. Or maybe I laughed. It was a good birthday. I think. I like cake. Cake is good.
