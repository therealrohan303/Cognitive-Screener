I wake up and wake up again. Then I brush. I go to the bathroom. Then I eat. I eat cereal. The cereal is crunchy. Then I eat toast. Toast is nice. I sometimes eat eggs, but toast is okay. I go to the living room. I turn on the TV. The TV talks. I don’t always understand the TV. The chair is soft. Then I go outside. I go outside or maybe stay inside. I don’t remember if it rained. It might have. Then lunch comes. I eat something. Maybe toast again. Then the TV is loud. The day is long and short. Then I go to bed. Or I stay up. It depends. Then I sleep.
