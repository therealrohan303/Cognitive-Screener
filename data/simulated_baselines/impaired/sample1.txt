I went to the store. I went to the store with my son. The store was big and had many things. I needed to buy bread. And milk. Bread and milk are important. My son helped. We walked to the bread. Then I saw the cookies. The cookies looked good. I remember when I was young. There was a park. We had swings. I liked the swings. My neighbor had a dog. The dog barked a lot. I think I forgot the milk. My son said something. He said, um, we had to go home. I didnâ€™t know what time it was. Then we went home. I think I left something behind. Maybe it was the cookies. Or the dog.
