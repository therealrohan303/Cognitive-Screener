It was the holidays. Lights and food. Lots of food. I saw the lights. The tree had lights. The tree was big. Or small. I helped. I helped with the tree. Or the food. I don’t know. People came. Family or friends. Or both. We ate. There was turkey. Or ham. Or something. I liked the pie. I think it was pie. Maybe apple. Maybe not. There were gifts. I gave a gift. I got one. I forgot what it was. But it was nice. We laughed. Or sang. Or talked. I don’t remember all of it. But I liked the lights. The lights were pretty. The lights were good.
