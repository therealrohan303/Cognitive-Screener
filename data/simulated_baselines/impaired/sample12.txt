I went to the bank. I had to go. I had a thing to do. I stood in line. The line was long. Long and quiet. People were standing. I looked around. There were numbers. I took a paper. I think it was a form. Or a slip. I had to write. I wrote my name. Or maybe I didn’t. The teller smiled. Or maybe not. I gave her the thing. She looked at it. She typed. I waited. I waited and looked. Then I got money. Or gave money. I don’t know. I put it in my pocket. Then I left. The door was heavy. Or maybe not. I went home.
